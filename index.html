								<p> Information technology 
								<p>Upon having deep interests in other fields such as Law and sports, information technology never crossed my mind. My knowledge regarding the topic of information technology was close to little or nothing however oddly enough my interest was sparked through the television show ‘Scorpion’. The more I watched the show and perceived how a group of individuals tackled crime through IT, the more my interests regarding cyber-crime and programming cultivated. I did more intensive research in this field and found the way in which writing small code could produce a greater outcome such as a website, software or a communication platform. I realised that people underrated the power of this field as this very world were living in is working efficiently the way it is due to information technology. 

I chose the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology because I believe it will provide me with an ample amount of opportunities as well as greatly expand my knowledge in ways that no other university can fulfil. The name of the university suggests the big and prestigious role, RMIT plays in Information Technology. Approaching this Bachelor of Technology with oblivion, I aim to delve deeper into the world of technology and learn the basic fundamentals of programming, user centred design and information technology as I believe they will play an important role throughout my progression in this course and IT world.

								<h2 class="The dream Job - Junior Software developer">Work</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="Mobile-App-Developers.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My ideal job revolves around a workplace that not only allows me to grow as an individual both intellectually and mentally but also teaches me new aspects of my expertise throughout the process. The Junior Software Developer position with a 7-ym positive solutions company is very fitting of what I deem a very ‘Ideal job’. The junior software developer position which specializes in creating business reporting software for corporate ‘businesses nationwide ‘creativity and possesses a passion to deliver modern content with a continuation of ‘next gen business’ reporting tools. The one thing that captivated me besides that fact that it revolves around software developing is the fact that it stresses on creativity and provides industry training to further my skills . For example, this position focuses on the continuous enhancement of their resources, analytics and interfaces so business are kept up to date with the current technology.

Although the job is very appealing it requires several skills, qualifications and experience. In order to obtain this job one needs to be motivated, problem solve and possess ‘efficient time and self-management skills’.  The individual should also acquire a positive approach to the workplace and co-workers. This position also requires great interpersonal skills such as strong communication skills both verbal and written as well as a team player that interacts well with team members to develop positive solutions. While some of these skills are easy to obtain, the position also requires essential practical skill that require experience such as a the ability to develop a well-structured code,  a high proficiency in java frameworks such Java script and IQuery as well as - Qualifications in IT/Software Engineering and PostgreSQL (MongoDB, Redis) . I have a long way to go in order to attain this position as it not only requires hard work but also adamant skills which I can develop throughout my course as well as other courses. For example, upon completing subjects such as user centred design, programming and introduction to information to technology, foundations regarding user interface, programming software and website’s can be developed which will enable to progress to dealing with Java framework and designing iterations. I also plan on progressing in completing a masters in Computer Science whereby I can enhance my skills if my interests regarding software developing are everlasting. This job is an amazing opportunity and I think it will be extremely beneficial

								<h2 class="Welcome to my hopeful world">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="IMG_2588 2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My name is Mariam Farah or in RMIT is system S3794646. I am born and raised in Melbourne, Carlton. My parents are both born in Somalia however fled their home country due to war and a deep intent to provide me and my 6 siblings with a better lifestyle. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Technology (computing studies) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am an avid football enthusiast, I have been playing and watching it ever since I was very young. Some people may deem me the most hopeful individual as I have been an Arsenal supporter my whole life. A team that has claimed many FA cups but not a premier league title in over a decade..</p>

								<h2 class="The self evaluation">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="IMG_2588 2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The tests taken served as an eye opener for me and allowed me to perceive my personality type, learning style and level of creativity. I personally would not have taken any of these tests before completing the assignment only due to a clouded judgement the questions would not be relatable however my perception has changed. Upon taking the Myer Briggs test I discovered I was more of a ‘thinker’ than a ‘feeler’ when it comes to my orientation of personal values which surprised me because I thought I was a individual who relied on emotion rather than reason and logic. These tests not only changed my perception but also allowed me to discover a part of my personality which may impact me for the rest of my life. For example, discovering that I was a tactile learner, an individual who learns by touching and doing and remembers and understands aspects through physical movement provided me with clarity. I never really thought there was such a type of learning style and always deemed myself a ‘visual learner’ which was incorrect. I also took a creativity tests to discover my level of creativity and realised I was an “out-of-the-box thinker” who enjoys exploring different ideas, pushing beyond the rules, conventions and of standard ways of thinking and doing things. I realised that while the tests were completely different they somehow related and emphasised that I was a deep thinker. Ultimately these tests were really helpful and provided me with clarity.
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?  
I think these results will allow me to work better in a team given now that I have an idea my personality type, high level of creativity and learning style. It will allow me to approach my team with more of an open mind, as these tests not only portrayed my personality type and learning style but also taught me about the other many personality types and learning styles.
 I think that the tests taken should be taken into account when forming a team to define roles in a team and provide more clarity on the individuals strengths and weaknesses. For example, if some of the team involves ‘feelers’ which are people who rely on emotion then those individuals should deal with the parts of the project that involve empathy such as customers and user interface design while the ones who deem themselves ‘thinkers’ should deal with the components of the project that involve problem solving .For example, thinking about technical difficulties that may arise in the projector the outcome of the project.

                                <article id="The Project- The study app">
								<h2 class="The Study App">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="IMG_2588 2.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We live in a very diverse world where everyone is different and unique however one thing every single person can agree on and find common ground is the fact we all procrastinate. We all find it hard to study or complete assignments because writing notes off a piece of paper or memorising content is simply boring. I believe individuals would procrastinate less if the content they studied was presented in a different format and platform. The idea of studying even demotivates some individuals. The study app will aid in the presentation of our study material in the form of a game. The game app that I aim to develop will greatly aid individuals in several circumstances whether it be a quick study session or a long all-nighter for a 3-hour exam. The game will include not only contain components such as a memory game and practise quizzes that are completed in levels but also take into account the learning style of the individual. All the user will need to do is place all the information into the ‘access menu’ and the app will compose it.

The study game app will not only be interesting but benefit all individuals as somewhere in our lives we will need to learn some sort of content that doesn’t naturally spark our interest. For example, a student studying for their least favourite subject or an employee needing to learn their new business policies. The fact that the app takes into account the learning style of the individual makes it wholly useful and counteracts that ‘one size fits all’ ideology that is evident in most apps these days. This app will mostly benefit students as it encourages active learning. The main reason behind students failing classes these days may be due to the demotivation that is provoked by the idea of sitting down and learning or memorising content off a book they will probably forget right after they exit the exam. A 2014 study, published by the scientific journal PNAS, found that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than students in environments with active learning. Using the study game app will allow students to not only regularly learn their content but also revisit the content so they are able to revisit this information and remember it.


The study game is a very useful app however requires intense user interaction. The game app has various features including a component that allows the individual to identify their learning style. The game begins with a small quiz that will identify your learning style involving whether the individual is a visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinaesthetic. The user will then place the content on the app. For example, a student can upload set of definitions, explanations and examples they find difficult to remember. Once the individual has placed their content in the app, the app will compose the data and match it up with their learning style in a collection of quizzes, flash cards, lists For example, matching up words with pictures of definitions to suit visual learners. 

The app includes a very thorough and understandable main menu and also contains levels and a main goal whereby Individuals are able to challenge themselves. For example, completing 10 definitions in a day allows an individual to proceed to the next level with more complicated and advanced definitions.

The study game app will be found on the app store and game store and can be purchased for free. The study game will also have a feedback section in the main menu to track user satisfaction and continuously improve the app.

Developing the study app will require many tools and software such as coding tools such as Eclipse.For example One software that will be useful and is Appery, is a cloud-based mobile app builder . Appery can be utilised in the creation of both Android and IOS and also includes Apache Cordova and Jquery Mobile aswell as access to built in components that you can use to create apps for Android or iOS, and it includes Apache Cordova (Phone Gap), Ionic, and jQuery Mobile which is accompanied by access to its built-in components.
.


The development of the mobile application will involve a combination of procedures and skills such as programming and building software. The individual or group developing the app will need to be familiar with programming, user interface design and mobile applications. For example, the skill of having experience and familiarity with the frequently used programming languages such as java and C# as well as training in web development languages such as CSS and HTML.A familiarity with mobile platform Application Programming Interfaces such as Apple iOS, Android and Windows Mobile is also required as the ability to implement th e utilisation of mobile suites like Antenna and Accounting-Management-Promotion.


One of the most important aspects of the project will be developing a sophisticated and high user interface as the interaction between the user and software is highly influenced by the user interface For example, the backend functionality will be one thing but the main aspect that will attract and obtain customers will be the design such as a fast loading application, general help and basic tips as well as activity indicators will shape the superiority of the app which will be among many. Another skill that is significant in the project will be Backend Computing which will involve security, database management t and the implementation of memory allocation to warrant the apps existence and safety. Developing this app will also require Business capability and knowledge as business skills play a precarious role in this field.To ensure the apps success one must need to know how to optimise a how to heighten the application’s visibility and role in the list of the available applications of the same category.The business and marketing side of app development will need to be made a focal point and considered deeply to ensure the apps success.

If the study app is successful, I believe the outcome will be much greater as many individuals will be able to have greater access to education. Many individuals struggle with the memory component that is involved and knowing that an app like this will may relieve this struggle and make it easier is elevating. The study app’s flexibility and open-mindedness may impact many as it stresses on user interaction.
